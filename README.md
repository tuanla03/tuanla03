## Hi there!

I'm Tuan, a Cybersecurity Student based in Vietnam, with a strong passion to be a Network Engineering. I enjoy configuring and assist on designing network infrastructures.

Although I sometimes face challenging commands that don't work (a network engineer's daily life! 😅), I am committed to finding the solution.

I'm familiar with configuring Cisco devices ( CCNA ); Basic proficiency in Python; Comfortable with Debian-based OS commands (Ubuntu, Kali Linux) and Configuring Windows Server. ( and ofcourse, Windows Desktop too )

I upload projects and anything that interests me ( just don't often 😪 )

Feel free to reach out or connect with me on other social media platforms!

Fun Facts About Me:<br>
▹ I have 3 cat ( all of them are orange 🐈 )<br>
▹ I love staying active by playing badminton 🏸 and practicing Muay Thai 🥊. ( sometimes 🤷‍♂️ )<br>
▹ I'm into Japanese things ( language, culture, anime,... )
